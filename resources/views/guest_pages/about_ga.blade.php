        Gamma Alpha chapter was chartered in April of 1933. Mr. Fred Payton called a meeting at the old YMCA building on 3rd Avenue for the purpose of organizing a graduate chapter in the Roanoke area. Twenty-six men met on that day, lighting a torch in the community that integrated the ideals of Manhood, Scholarship, Perseverance, and Uplift.

        After the initial meeting brothers Hersey T. Steptoe, Dr. Sterling Brown, Dr. Robert "Whirlwind" Johnson and Professor Jessie Williams from the Gamma Omega chapter in Lynchburg, VA helped guide the brothers in their organization and quest for a charter. Gamma Alpha chapter was granted a charter at the Grand Conclave in Durham, NC on April 4, 1932. The following brothers were charter members of the chapter: Frederick D. Lawson, Aubrey 0. Dent, Arnett G. Macklin, J.C. Toles, Wilmer F. Dillard, J. Arthur Spencer, William Spencer, William Scott, Ambrose Williams, Ralph Coleman, Richard Jones, Ballard Majors, and Fred Payton.

        Some of the early projects the chapter incorporated into the Roanoke Valley and Martinsville areas were the establishment of a scholarship fund for high school graduates, the registration of African-American voters, the recognition of an African-American Citizen of the Year, and the implementation of achievement recognition programs through the fraternity's high school essay and talent hunt contests. During the 1930's the chapter made annual contributions to the NAACP, YMCA, and YWCA. It regularly celebrated Negro Achievement Week, Foster Boys and Girls Week, and provided scholarship dances and intercollegiate basketball games. Some of the early leaders and members of the Omega Honor Roll in the valley were A.G. Macklin, Principal of Lucy Addison High School; William Scott, Pastor of the largest Baptist church in Salem, VA; William P Dillard, the first African-American Director of Recreation for the City of Roanoke; and Harry T. Penn, dentist and drug store proprietor.
